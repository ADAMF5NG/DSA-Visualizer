# Getting Started with Django 

## Avaible Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `python manage.py runserver`

Runs the server

### `python manage.py makemigrations`

Creates new migration files based on changed made in Django model
When you modify your models (e.g., add a new field, remove a field, change a field's type), 
Django needs to generate corresponding database schema changes. These changes are stored as migration files in your app's migrations directory.
Go to root directory where `manage.py` is 

### `python manage.py migrate`

The migrate command is used to apply database schema changes to your database based on the migration files generated by makemigrations.
When you run python manage.py migrate, Django looks at the unapplied migration files in your project and applies them to the database, updating the database schema accordingly.
Go to root directory where `manage.py` is 

### `python manage.py startapp app_name`

Creates a new  directory with specified app_name
contains all files and folders for new Dango App
